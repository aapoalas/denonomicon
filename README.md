The Dark Arts of Deno Foreign Function Interface Programming

This repository is intended to serve as a deep dive into FFI programming in
Deno. The aims of the document are:

1. Document the capabilities and limitations of Deno FFI in its entirety, not
   limited to the TypeScript types and their direct implications.
2. Document the internal implementations underpinning Deno FFI, including any
   and all data conversions inherent in it.
3. Document various examples of Deno FFI usage with various languages, including
   but not limited to actual C API usage.
4. Document various possible exploits and security vulnerabilities that Deno FFI
   usage may open up, and what can be done about them.

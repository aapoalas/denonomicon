# Introduction

This document is incomplete and haunted by spirits conjured into existence by
the evils within. Be protected by the Deno Shrine Maiden.

## The Dark Arts of Deno Foreign Function Interface

The Denonomicon digs into all the sordid details of the Deno Foreign Function
Inteface (henceforth Deno FFI). It is intended to bridge any knowledge gaps left
behind by the [Deno Manual] and TypeScript definitions of FFI.

This document will not provide guidance on TypeScript programming itself, nor
will it explain any Deno specific APIs used other than FFI itself. If you want
to know how to write Deno programs, then refer to the [Deno Manual]. If you want
to know how to interface with C APIs from Deno, how to do it well and what sorts
of pitfalls await you, then please do come in.
